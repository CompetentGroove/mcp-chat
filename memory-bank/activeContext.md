# Active Context: y-gui

## Current Focus
Implementing a web-based GUI for chat interactions, with data stored in Cloudflare KV and R2. The focus is on creating a secure, responsive interface that provides seamless access to chat functionality.

## Recent Changes
1. Project structure established with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers
2. Basic components created (App, ChatList, ChatView)
3. Cloudflare Worker implementation for KV/R2 access
4. Initial API endpoints for chat operations
5. SWR integration for data fetching
6. Tailwind CSS setup for styling

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
- React with TypeScript for frontend
- Cloudflare Workers for backend
- SWR for data management
- Repository pattern for storage
- Component-based UI structure

### Implementation Approach
- Modular component design
- Responsive layout with Tailwind
- API-first development
- Edge computing with Workers
- Progressive enhancement

## Current Considerations

### Authentication
- Simple secret key implementation
- Token-based session management
- Secure storage access
- API security

### User Experience
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Real-time updates
- Chat interactions

### Storage
- KV for active chats
- R2 for backups
- Data synchronization
- Access patterns
- Performance optimization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement authentication system
2. Enhance chat components
3. Add AI provider integration
4. Improve error handling
5. Add loading states

### Future Tasks
1. Implement search functionality
2. Add chat filtering
3. Enhance UI/UX
4. Add additional features
5. Optimize performance

## Open Questions
1. Best practices for secret key distribution
2. Optimal storage patterns for chat data
3. Error handling strategies
4. Performance optimization approaches
5. Future feature priorities

## Current Status
Initial project setup complete with basic functionality. Focus on implementing authentication and enhancing chat interactions. Core components and worker implementation in place, moving towards a fully functional web interface.
