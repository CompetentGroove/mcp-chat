# Active Context: y-gui

## Current Focus
Enhancing the web-based GUI for chat interactions with bot configuration and MCP server management. The focus is on creating a secure, responsive interface that provides seamless access to chat functionality with configurable AI providers and MCP servers. Recently integrated Auth0 authentication to replace the basic secret key authentication system.

## Recent Changes
1. Project structure established with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers
2. Basic components created (App, Home, ChatView)
3. Cloudflare Worker implementation for KV/R2 access
4. Initial API endpoints for chat operations
5. SWR integration for data fetching
6. Tailwind CSS setup for styling
7. Bot configuration UI implemented in Settings component
8. MCP server configuration UI implemented in Settings component
9. Chat interface with message display and metadata
10. Bot and MCP server configuration fetching from Cloudflare R2
11. API endpoints for configuration management
12. JSONL format for configuration storage
13. Basic chat conversation function
14. Message sending functionality implemented
15. Improved MCP tool handling in chat completions API:
    - Modified to parse tools and clean assistant messages (removing tool parameter parts)
    - Updated to end response immediately after tool detection without waiting for confirmation
    - Enhanced tool confirmation endpoint to directly execute MCP tools after confirmation
16. Integrated Auth0 authentication:
    - Added @auth0/auth0-react SDK
    - Replaced secret key authentication with Auth0
    - Added Google login support
    - Created authenticated API utilities
    - Updated components to use Auth0 hooks

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
- React with TypeScript for frontend
- Cloudflare Workers for backend
- SWR for data management
- Repository pattern for storage
- Component-based UI structure

### Implementation Approach
- Modular component design
- Responsive layout with Tailwind
- API-first development
- Edge computing with Workers
- Progressive enhancement
- Configuration-driven bot and MCP server management

## Current Considerations

### Authentication
- Auth0 integration for secure authentication
- Google social login support
- Token-based session management
- Secure storage access
- API security with Auth0 tokens

### User Experience
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Real-time updates
- Chat interactions
- Bot configuration management
- MCP server configuration

### Storage
- KV for active chats
- R2 for backups
- Data synchronization
- Access patterns
- Performance optimization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Configure backend to validate Auth0 tokens
2. Add Home Page and refactor chat history search
3. Add chat catalog for multi round messages
4. Implement bot and MCP server configuration editing
5. Enhance error handling for message sending
6. Add loading states for message sending

### Future Tasks
1. Implement search functionality
2. Add chat filtering
3. Enhance UI/UX
4. Add additional features like voice and video support
5. Optimize performance

## Open Questions
1. Optimal storage patterns for chat data
2. Error handling strategies
3. Performance optimization approaches
4. Future feature priorities
5. Best approach for managing bot and MCP server configurations
6. Additional Auth0 features to implement (roles, permissions, etc.)

## Current Status
Basic bot and MCP configuration display implemented. Chat interface fully functional with message display, metadata, and message sending capabilities. Settings component allows viewing bot and MCP server configurations. Basic chat sending function is now complete.

Auth0 authentication has been integrated to replace the basic secret key authentication. The system now supports:
- Login with Auth0 Universal Login
- Google social login
- Secure token management
- Authenticated API requests

MCP tool handling has been streamlined with the following improvements:
1. When an AI response contains a tool use, the system now:
   - Extracts the tool information
   - Saves only the plain text part to the assistant message (removing XML tool parameters)
   - Immediately ends the response after sending tool information to the client
   
2. The tool confirmation endpoint now:
   - Directly executes the MCP tool after receiving confirmation
   - Creates a new user message with the tool result
   - Adds this message to the chat history
   - Returns the result to the client

Next steps include configuring the backend to validate Auth0 tokens, implementing editing capabilities for configurations, and enhancing the home page.
