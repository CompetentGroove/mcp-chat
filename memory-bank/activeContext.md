# Active Context: y-gui

## Current Focus
Enhancing the web-based GUI for chat interactions with bot configuration and MCP server management. The focus is on creating a secure, responsive interface that provides seamless access to chat functionality with configurable AI providers and MCP servers.

## Recent Changes
1. Project structure established with React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare Workers
2. Basic components created (App, Home, ChatView)
3. Cloudflare Worker implementation for KV/R2 access
4. Initial API endpoints for chat operations
5. SWR integration for data fetching
6. Tailwind CSS setup for styling
7. Bot configuration UI implemented in Settings component
8. MCP server configuration UI implemented in Settings component
9. Chat interface with message display and metadata
10. Bot and MCP server configuration fetching from Cloudflare R2
11. API endpoints for configuration management
12. JSONL format for configuration storage
13. Basic chat conversation function
14. Message sending functionality implemented

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
- React with TypeScript for frontend
- Cloudflare Workers for backend
- SWR for data management
- Repository pattern for storage
- Component-based UI structure

### Implementation Approach
- Modular component design
- Responsive layout with Tailwind
- API-first development
- Edge computing with Workers
- Progressive enhancement
- Configuration-driven bot and MCP server management

## Current Considerations

### Authentication
- Simple secret key implementation
- Token-based session management
- Secure storage access
- API security

### User Experience
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Real-time updates
- Chat interactions
- Bot configuration management
- MCP server configuration

### Storage
- KV for active chats
- R2 for backups
- Data synchronization
- Access patterns
- Performance optimization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add Home Page and refactor chat history search
2. Add chat catalog for multi round messages
3. Implement bot and MCP server configuration editing
4. Enhance error handling for message sending
5. Add loading states for message sending

### Future Tasks
1. Implement search functionality
2. Add chat filtering
3. Enhance UI/UX
4. Add additional features like voice and video support
5. Optimize performance

## Open Questions
1. Best practices for secret key distribution
2. Optimal storage patterns for chat data
3. Error handling strategies
4. Performance optimization approaches
5. Future feature priorities
6. Best approach for managing bot and MCP server configurations

## Current Status
Basic bot and MCP configuration display implemented. Chat interface fully functional with message display, metadata, and message sending capabilities. Settings component allows viewing bot and MCP server configurations. Basic chat sending function is now complete. Next steps include implementing editing capabilities for configurations, enhancing the home page, and completing the authentication system.
